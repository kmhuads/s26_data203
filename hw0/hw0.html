<p>You are being encouraged to turn the assignment in using the provided
Jupyter Notebook. To do so, make a directory in your Lab environment
called <code>homework/hw0</code>. Put all of your files in that
directory. Then zip or tar that directory, rename it with your name as
the first part of the filename (e.g. <code>maull_hw0_files.zip</code>,
<code>maull_hw0_files.tar.gz</code>), then download it to your local
machine, then upload the <code>.zip</code> to Canvas.</p>
<p>If you do not know how to do this, please ask, or visit one of the
many tutorials out there on the basics of using zip in Linux.</p>
<p>If you choose not to use the provided notebook, you will still need
to turn in a <code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter Notebook and corresponding
files according to the instructions in this homework.</p>

Familiarize yourself with the JupyterLab environment, Markdown and
Python</h3>
<p>As stated in the course announcement <a
href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter (https://jupyter.org)</a> is the core
platform we will be using in this course and is a popular platform for
data scientists around the world. We have a JupyterLab setup for this
course so that we can operate in a cloud-hosted environment, free from
some of the resource constraints of running Jupyter on your local
machine (though you are free to set it up on your own and seek my advice
if you desire).</p>
<p>You have been given the information about the Jupyter environment we
have setup for our course, and the underlying Python environment will be
using is the <a href="https://anaconda.com">Anaconda
(https://anaconda.com)</a> distribution. It is not necessary for this
assignment, but you are free to look at the multitude of packages
installed with Anaconda, though we will not use the majority of them
explicitly.</p>
<p>As you will soon find out, Notebooks are an incredibly effective way
to mix code with narrative and you can create cells that are entirely
code or entirely Markdown. Markdown (MD or <code>md</code>) is a highly
readable text format that allows for easy documentation of text files,
while allowing for HTML-based rendering of the text in a way that is
style-independent.</p>
<p>We will be using Markdown frequently in this course, and you will
learn that there are many different “flavors” of Markdown. We will only
be using the basic flavor, but you will benefit from exploring the
“Github flavored” Markdown, though you will not be responsible for using
it in this course – only the “basic” flavor. Please refer to the
original course announcement about Markdown.</p>
<p><strong>§ Task:</strong> <strong>THERE IS NOTHING TO TURN IN FOR THIS
PART.</strong></p>
<p>Play with and become familiar with the basic functions of the Lab
environment given to you online in the course.</p>
<p><strong>§ Task:</strong> <strong>THERE IS NOTHING TO TURN IN FOR THIS
PART.</strong></p>
<p>Please <em>create a markdown document</em> and read the documentation
for basic Markdown <a
href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax">here</a>. Learn to use
all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>headings (one level is fine),</li>
<li>bullets,</li>
<li>bold and italics</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, the content of your documentcan be whatever you like, just
learn some of the basic functionality of Markdown.</p>
<h3 id="familiarize-yourself-with-github-and-basic-git">(0%) Familiarize
yourself with Github and basic git</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com">Github (https://github.com)</a> is the
<em>de facto</em> platform for open source software in the world based
on the very popular <a href="https://git-scm.org">git
(https://git-scm.org)</a> version control system. Git has a
sophisticated set of tools for version control based on the concept of
local repositories for fast commits and remote repositories only when
collaboration and remote synchronization is necessary. Github enhances
git by providing tools and online hosting of public and private
repositories to encourage and promote sharing and collaboration. Github
hosts some of the world’s most widely used open source software.</p>
<p><strong>If you are already familiar with git and Github, then this
part will be very easy!</strong></p>
<p><strong>§ Task:</strong> <strong>Create a public Github repo named
<code>"hu-f25-data203"</code> and place a <code>README.md</code> file in
it.</strong></p>
<p>Create your first file called <code>README.md</code> at the top level
of the repository.</p>
<p>Please put your Github username in the file. Aside from that you can
put whatever text you like in the file (If you like, use something like
<a href="https://lipsum.com/">lorem ipsum</a> to generate random
sentences to place in the file.). Please include the link to
<strong>your</strong> Github repository that now includes the minimal
<code>README.md</code>. You don’t have to have anything elaborate in
that file or the repo.</p>
<p><strong>§ Task:</strong> <strong>Fork the course
repository.</strong></p>
<p>Learn to use Github workflows and fork the class repo:</p>
<ul>
<li><a

Explore JupyterHub Linux terminal console integrating what you learned
in the prior parts of this homework</h3>
<p>The Linux console in JupyterLab is a great way to perform
command-line tasks and is an essential tool for basic scripting that is
part of a data scientist’s toolkit. Open a terminal console in the lab
environment and familiarize yourself with your files and basic
commands.</p>
<p><strong>§ Task:</strong> <strong>Understand basic Linux file
operations</strong></p>
<p>Basic file operations go a long way to understand the way Linux
works. In this part, you will understand folders, files and making
revisions to a file. These files will be visible within Jupyter, which
makes moving from one platform to another seemless. We will create a
folder, file, make edits.</p>
<ul>
<li>open a Jupyter console</li>
<li>create a file called <code>README.md</code></li>
<li>type <code>mkdir your_folder_name</code> to create a folder in
filesystem <em>in the current folder where you are</em></li>
<li>use <code>cd your_folder_name</code> to “change directory” and move
into the folder you just created</li>
<li>use <code>pwd</code> to “print working directory” to verify you are
in the folder you created</li>
<li>create a file by type <code>touch README.md</code> the
<code>touch</code> command creates a file if it does not already exist,
otherwise it will change the timestamp of that file when it is
“touched”</li>
<li>type <code>echo "Hello this is test text." &gt; README.md</code>.
This will take the words you typed and “append them” into the file
<code>README.md</code></li>
<li>to see the contents of your file typing <code>cat README.md</code>
or <code>more README.md</code> or <code>less README.md</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>§ Task:</strong> <strong>Learn to quickly obtain remote files
in Linux</strong></p>
<p>The commands <code>wget</code> and <code>curl</code> are useful for
grabbing data and files from remote resources off the web. Using these
tools from the command line streamline your workflows and are often
faster than writing a program to do the same. These tools will also
expand and strengthen you data science skills, added a few more tools to
your toolkit is rarely a bad idea.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Read the documentation on each of these commands by typing
<code>man wget</code> or <code>man curl</code> in the terminal.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>man</code> stands for <em>manual</em> and nearly all versions
of Linux have such documentation pages for the majority of commands. If
it fails, try the command with the <code>-h</code> or
<code>--help</code> flag, such as <code>wget --help</code></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Make sure your output goes to a file and study the documentation
to the select the proper flags to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>You can obtain nearly any file anywhere on the Internet with
these commands. For example, the Library of Congress interview with jazz
great Herbie Hancock from the mid-1980s: <a
href="https://www.loc.gov/item/jsmith000096/">https://www.loc.gov/item/jsmith000096/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>click on this interview link</li>
<li>choose the dropdown for the <strong>mp3</strong></li>
<li>when the page opens up, there will be a player that starts the
interview, copy the URL</li>
<li>go to you Jupyter terminal and run the command
<code>wget &lt;the_url_you_just_copied&gt;</code>, where you will paste
the URL you just copied in the
<code>&lt;the_url_you_just_copied&gt;</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Either on the Library of Congress site or somewhere else, play
further with <code>wget</code> and <code>curl</code> to download some
other files you might have of interest.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="learn-more-about-and-use-string-manipulation">(100%) Learn more
about and use string manipulation</h3>
<p>We learned in lecture that strings are <em>sequences</em> in
Python.</p>
<p>We also learned that the sequence types have a number of basic
operations like concatenation, length, etc.</p>
<p>Strings have a lot of other operations on them that make them
exceedingly useful for text processing. In fact, Python is exceptionally
good at processing text, as you will see.</p>
<p>First things first, please go to the documentation on Python strings,
also known as <strong><code>str</code></strong> or “Text Sequence
Type”:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Study it and especially the String methods (see more here: <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods</a>).</p>
<p>You will be using this short <strong>AI-generated writeup
(qwen3-instruct/4B; note → there are <em>many</em> inaccuracies in the
generated text)</strong> about the impeccable jazz singer (<a
href="http://www.ellafitzgerald.com/">http://www.ellafitzgerald.com/</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ella Fitzgerald is an American jazz singer widely regarded as one of
the greatest and most influential vocalists in the history of jazz. Born
on April 25, 1916, in Newport News, Virginia, she developed a
distinctive voice and style that emphasized precision, phrasing, and
emotional expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fitzgerald was known for her impeccable timing, dynamic range, and
ability to improvise with grace and subtlety. She was a master of scat
singing and had a profound influence on the development of jazz vocal
styles. Her work with the legendary Louis Armstrong and her
collaborations with musicians like Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, and Ray
Charles helped shape the sound of jazz music.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She was also a key figure in the “crossover” movement, bringing jazz
to broader audiences through pop and film music. Fitzgerald recorded
over 1,000 songs and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the
National Recording Registry.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ella Fitzgerald passed away on June 15, 1996, in New York City,
leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire generations of
musicians and fans alike.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>§ Task:</strong> <strong>Basic String functions.</strong></p>
<p>Use the passage provided and answer the questions. <strong>Provide
your answer in a Jupyter Notebook.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Assign a variable called <code>passage</code> with the string
provided into a multi-line string using <code>"""</code> which we talked
about in lecture.<br />
Make sure you preserve the spaces between paragraphs, which are
<code>"\n\n"</code> (two newlines).</li>
<li>Use <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines"><code>str.splitlines()</code></a>
to determine how many paragraphs are in the string.<br />
Recall, <code>splitlines()</code> returns a <em>sequence</em> (i.e. a
list sequence), so counting the paragraphs is easier with
<code>len()</code>.</li>
<li>Use <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower"><code>lower()</code></a>
to produce the lowercase version of the whole string.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>§ Task:</strong> <strong>Advanced String
functions.</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have <code>passage</code> in a variable, there are a few
more String operations we want to try to familiarize ourselves with.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use <code>replace()</code> to replace all instances of the word
<code>" her "</code> with <code>###</code>.<br />
You would be advised to use <code>str.lower()</code> first so that all
of your words are <em>normalized</em>. <strong>Note also the spaces
around the word.</strong> So for example, the sentence
<code>"The place where her glove was lost."</code> would be
<code>"The place where ### hat was lost."</code>.</li>
<li>How many <code>" and "</code> words are in the passage?</li>
<li>How many times was the word <code>" jazz "</code> used in the
passage? Use the lowercase-normalized count.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>§ Task:</strong> <strong>Sequence iteration.</strong></p>
<p>Now we will put looping into our work and ask more complex questions
of the text.</p>
<p>To produce a list sequence of all the words in <code>passage</code>
then you will learn that <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split"><code>str.split()</code></a>
will be very valuable.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Study what <code>passage.split()</code> does and write a sentence
fragment explaining what it does.</li>
<li>Get the first paragraph (index 0), and return the number of words in
the paragraph. <strong>NOTE:</strong> you can include punctuation as
part of the word. You will make use of your solution in #2 and
<code>split()</code>.</li>
<li>Use a <code>for</code> loop with <code>split()</code> to print all
words that end in <code>"ing"</code>. Provide the count of such words.
<strong>Note</strong>: you do not have to remove punctuation, so if you
end up with an item like <code>"walking,"</code> you can ignore it in
your count.</li>
<li>How many words end in <code>"er"</code>? Provide the list of those
words. You will need to use a <code>for</code> loop.</li>
<li>How many times does the word <code>"Ella"</code> appear in the
passage?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>§ Task:</strong> <strong>Find AI errors.</strong></p>
<p>The text was AI-generated and so has errors in it. For 1 point, list
at least one incorrect statement in the passage. You might use: <a
